## Hi, my name is Lily. 
## I am a second-year student planning to major in **Economics** and **LLS**. I have no prior knowledge of programming, but I'm willing to learn :smiling_face_with_three_hearts: Hopefully by the end of this quarter, I can be more confident in following the Economics Standard Track.
## Places you are most likely to find me:
* The Mansueto Grand Reading room (*IT'S THE BEST!!*)
* Harper (*I have a class there, and who can resist the charm of the third-floor reading room that's like Hogwarts??*)
* Campus North Residential Commons
  * Anyone who's in Trott House as well?
